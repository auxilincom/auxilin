          known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (ii) is
          or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party;
          (iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party
          without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (iv) is independently
          developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such
          information. The Receiving Party may make disclosures to the extent
          required by Law or court order, provided the Receiving Party notifies
          the Disclosing Party in advance and cooperates in any effort to obtain
          confidential treatment. The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure
          of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which
          damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that
          upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party
          will be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to
          whatever other remedies it might have at Law.`}
