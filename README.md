A toolkit for makers to ship better products faster 🚀. 

[Auxilin](https://github.com/auxilincom/auxilin) is a tool which help you setup your new product in matter of minutes. Auxilin is based on a number of open-source components, resulted from years of hard work on a number of awesome products. We carefully select, document and share our production-ready knowledge with you. 

We encourage developers to share production-ready solutions and help to  business ship something people need as quick as possible. 

If you're looking to start your new product based on Auxilin we'd be happy to provide you with a free consultation. Contact Auxilin at launch@auxilin.com.

## Why Auxilin?

Shipping is crucial part of any new product. The quicker you ship, the more time you have to validate your hypotheses. The quicker you validate your idea, the sooner you know if you're building what people want.

In the rush, developers often ignore quality. Backups, monitoring, proper data validation and many other things seems not so important in the beginning. Sometimes you're lucky, sometimes not.

We believe we could ship great products faster, while maintain decent quality and have a plan for scaling when hypotheses where right.

## Core concepts

* We automatically build ship out of the number of smaller components. Our ultimate goal is too keep only parts your need for your product development.
* Every component is kept is tiny as possible to simplify maintenance and stay up to date with new releases. 
* Auxilin is always in production ready state. We test every release manually to make sure great developer experience. We use auxilin to build our own products, see more [here](https://github.com/auxilincom/auxilin).
